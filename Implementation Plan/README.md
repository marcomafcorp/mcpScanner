# MCP Security Scanner - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

The MCP Security Scanner is a comprehensive application designed to scan Modular/Managed Control Planes (MCPs) for security vulnerabilities. It performs both passive analysis (dependency & config inspection) and active testing (port probes, OWASP Top-10 style HTTP tests, credential brute-force simulation, etc.), generates CVSS-style severity scores with remediation advice, and presents results through a modern React dashboard.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Async/await style
- Poetry
- Security libraries: python-nmap, scapy, bandit, OWASP Dependency-Check CLI wrapper
- SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic
- JWT with PyJWT + OAuth2 password flow
- Celery + Redis for async tasks

### Database
- PostgreSQL 15 (SQLite for quick development)

### Frontend
- React 18 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide-React icons
- Recharts for visualization

### DevOps
- Docker-compose (separate web, api, db)
- Pre-commit hooks (ruff, black)
- GitHub Actions CI

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into 5 phases:

1. [Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure](./PHASE-1.md)
2. [Phase 2: Scanner Engine & API](./PHASE-2.md)
3. [Phase 3: Auth, Security, and Compliance](./PHASE-3.md)
4. [Phase 4: Dashboard UI & Visualization](./PHASE-4.md)
5. [Phase 5: Documentation, Diagrams, and Finalization](./PHASE-5.md)

Each phase has a detailed todo list with corresponding test plans to ensure functionality works as expected.

## Project Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-2 weeks | Project structure, Docker setup, CI pipeline |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 weeks | Scanner engine, API endpoints, database schema |
| Phase 3 | 1-2 weeks | Authentication, security measures, compliance features |
| Phase 4 | 2-3 weeks | Dashboard UI, visualization components, responsive design |
| Phase 5 | 1 week | Documentation, diagrams, example tests, future work |

## Success Criteria

- All functional requirements implemented and tested
- 90%+ test coverage
- Secure, compliant, and production-ready application
- Complete documentation including setup instructions and architecture diagrams
- Responsive and user-friendly dashboard UI
